00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:15,600
(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,871
I never wanted the spotlight, I wanted the blueprint,

3
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,707
something solid underneath when the ground get thin.

4
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:21,382
While they argue colors for the outside view,

5
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:23,378
I'm counting load, stress, what the frame go through.

6
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:25,532
I seen dreams collapse from a weak foundation,

7
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,367
every big talk fail basic calculation.

8
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:29,121
Everybody wanna shine in the finished space,

9
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:30,718
nobody wanna stay when it's bricks and weight.

10
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:32,472
I don't draw lines just to make 'em look clever,

11
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:34,468
I draw lines so the whole thing last forever.

12
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,064
Pressure test every wall I design,

13
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,899
if it hold under doubt, it'll hold under time.

14
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:40,052
She say "slow down," I say "watch this,"

15
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,409
every move quiet but it all connect.

16
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:43,164
I don't rush highs, I respect the process,

17
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,920
that's how you turn chaos into progress.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,994
I build when it's boring, I build when it's tense,

19
00:00:47,073 --> 00:00:48,988
when nobody claps, I'm still in the fence.

20
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,664
They see the tower and think it appeared,

21
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:52,100
I see every night that it took to get here.

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,659
Yeah,

23
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,176
I don't need credit, I need it correct.

24
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,850
If it stand without me, I did it right.

25
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,447
I don't chase applause, I chase effect,

26
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:59,761
when they move inside it — that's success.

27
00:00:59,761 --> 00:00:60,000
(PRE-CHORUS)

28
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:01,116
I'm the architect,

29
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:03,031
not of dreams, of weight.

30
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,706
Not of hype, of fate.

31
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:07,021
I don't talk — I calculate.

32
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:07,200
(CHORUS)

33
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,138
I'm the architect,

34
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,132
when it shake, I don't run.

35
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:11,968
I stay calm, adjust,

36
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:14,281
til the whole thing becomes.
