1
00:00:20,504 --> 00:00:20,824
(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:22,739
No sparks now — just lines and angles,

3
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,292
noise burned off with the old entangles.

4
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,846
Heart still beat but it don't gamble,

5
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:30,318
mind cut clean like it solved the puzzle.

6
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:32,073
I don't flinch when the pressure stare,

7
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,387
already cracked — what's left to scare?

8
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,180
Silence thick but it's breathable air,

9
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:39,573
every move measured, nothing spare.

10
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,048
(PRE-CHORUS)

11
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:43,085
Stillness — sharpened edge,

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,362
I don't rush, I step correct.

13
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,036
Stillness — loaded breath,

14
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:47,234
I don't swing, I intercept.

15
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,430
Stillness — weaponized,

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,628
calm so cold it reorganize.

17
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:50,904
Stillness — that's the shift,

18
00:00:50,904 --> 00:00:51,701
when survival turn into discipline.

19
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:51,941
(VERSE 2)

20
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,856
Used to think force meant raising voice,

21
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:56,409
now I see power is fewer choice.

22
00:00:56,968 --> 00:00:58,883
Every word land like it got a point,

23
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:01,116
I don't waste breath — I deploy.

24
00:01:01,356 --> 00:01:03,430
World still loud but it pass me by,

25
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,063
I move straight through like a narrowed eye.

26
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:08,378
You hear chaos — I hear reply,

27
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,930
pattern visible when the fear don't cry.

28
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,250
(BRIDGE)

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,128
I don't freeze.

30
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:14,361
I align.

31
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:17,153
I don't fight.

32
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,706
I decide.

33
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:21,701
(CHORUS)

34
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:22,899
Stillness — sharpened edge,

35
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,176
I don't rush, I step correct.

36
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,451
Stillness — loaded breath,

37
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,808
I don't swing, I intercept.

38
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:28,004
Stillness — weaponized,

39
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,920
calm so cold it reorganize.
