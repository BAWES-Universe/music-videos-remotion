1
00:00:00,638 --> 00:00:24,335
(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:27,686
I was born from dust and duty,

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,191
Built by hands that learned to break,

4
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:39,573
Every scar became my blueprint,

5
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,840
Every failure shaped my faith.

6
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:47,951
(PRE-CHORUS)

7
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:50,664
I don’t move fast — I move right,

8
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:54,573
One task, one truth, one light.

9
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:54,734
(CHORUS)

10
00:00:54,734 --> 00:01:00,878
Brick by brick, I breathe, I rise,

11
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:04,787
Heart of work beneath the skies.

12
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:07,579
When the world forgets its name,

13
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:11,010
I remember — I remain.

14
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,596
(VERSE 2)

15
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:19,867
Weight and pressure are my teachers,

16
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,293
Fire carves the lines of grace,

17
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:31,277
Time bends slow beneath my fingers,

18
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,941
Stone remembers every face.

19
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:40,531
(PRE-CHORUS)

20
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:44,201
Not a cog, not a slave — I build,

21
00:01:46,277 --> 00:01:51,382
Every pulse, a world fulfilled.

22
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:54,016
(CHORUS)

23
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,808
Brick by brick, I breathe, I rise,

24
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:59,680
Heart of work beneath the skies.

25
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,951
Every rhythm, every strain,

26
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:06,063
Feeds the pulse that breaks the chain.

27
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:12,765
(BRIDGE)

28
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,239
Hear the ticking, hammer’s hymn,

29
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:18,350
Where endings start and starts begin.

30
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,063
Through the dust, the heart still drums

31
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:21,941
—

32
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:27,765
Brick by brick — the builder comes.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,717
(OUTRO)

34
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:37,500
Not for glory, not for gold,

35
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:43,245
But to finish what was told.

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,068
Brick by brick, the phoenix breathes,

37
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,967
From the weight — eternity.

38
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:57,765
(CHORUS)

39
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:01,116
Brick by brick, I breathe, I rise,

40
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:05,105
Heart of work beneath the skies.

41
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:07,899
When the world forgets its name,

42
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:11,250
I remember — I remain.
