1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,484
From the dirt to the dawn, I ignite with a roar,

2
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,356
Kicked the coffin wide open, now I’m back for more.

3
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:19,228
Every step’s a spark, every breath’s a flame,

4
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,861
Put respect on my rise, they remember the name.

5
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:24,734
I burn fear to smoke, turn pain into gold,

6
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,527
I’m the chapter they whisper but never get told.

7
00:00:27,846 --> 00:00:30,160
Every scar’s a medal, every loss a win,

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,191
I’m the storm in the fire, let the uprising begin.

9
00:00:34,707 --> 00:00:39,255
From ashes to anthems, we rise, we rise,

10
00:00:40,213 --> 00:00:44,761
No chains, no ceilings, just skies, skies, skies.

11
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:50,426
From ashes to anthems, we fight, we fight,

12
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:55,371
Hands up, hearts loud, all night, all night!

13
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:58,244
I’m the heat in the heartbeat, the bass in your chest,

14
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:01,197
When the world said “quit,” I just laughed at the test.

15
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:03,750
I’m the light in the blackout, the crown in the smoke,

16
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,382
If you’re waiting for a savior, here’s the one they spoke.

17
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:09,415
I don’t beg for the throne, I just take the seat,

18
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:12,206
Every bar’s built in fire, every line’s concrete.

19
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:15,159
Legends ain’t born, nah, legends get made,

20
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,951
In the furnace of the fight where the brave don’t fade.

21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,649
From ashes to anthems, we rise, we rise,

22
00:01:27,605 --> 00:01:32,233
No chains, no ceilings, just skies, skies, skies.

23
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:38,138
From ashes to anthems, we fight, we fight,

24
00:01:38,218 --> 00:01:43,084
Hands up, hearts loud, all night, all night!

25
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,079
Sing it for the ones who fell,

26
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:48,031
Sing it for the ones who burned,

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,745
We carry their names in the beat,

28
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:53,697
Till every tide has turned.

29
00:01:54,495 --> 00:02:03,430
Rise! Rise! Rise!
30
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:08,616
Light it up! Light it up!
31
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:16,515
From the dust! From the dust!
32
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:28,723
We don’t break! We combust!
33
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,956
Yeah, we’re phoenix-born, with our hearts on fire,

34
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:33,830
Every dream we lost only takes us higher.

35
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,223
From the dirt to the dawn, hear the battle choir,

36
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:39,254
Ashes to anthems — this is our empire.

37
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:47,552
From ashes to anthems, we rise, we rise,

38
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,298
No chains, no ceilings, just skies, skies, skies.

39
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:58,802
From ashes to anthems, we fight, we fight,

40
00:02:59,043 --> 00:03:04,229
Hands up, hearts loud, all night, all night!
