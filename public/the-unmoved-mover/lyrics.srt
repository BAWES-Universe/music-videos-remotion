1
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,260
(Intro – whispered choir)

2
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:25,452
Before the spark, before the sound,

3
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:30,399
a calm that holds the turning ground.

4
00:00:31,356 --> 00:00:35,904
Nothing moved — yet all began,

5
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:38,936
and stillness wrote the plan.

6
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:44,042
(Verse 1)

7
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:46,116
Galaxies drift like leaves in air,

8
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,909
each one drawn by silence there.

9
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,265
Every cause, every chain,

10
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:51,383
traces back where no change came.

11
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:51,701
(Pre-Hook)

12
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:52,738
No engine, no flame,

13
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:53,777
only order without a name.

14
00:00:53,777 --> 00:00:54,176
(Hook)

15
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:57,207
The Unmoved Mover, center of the spin,

16
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:59,761
circle without start or end within.

17
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:03,590
All things flow, return, and blend—

18
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:05,426
motion born from what won’t bend.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,254
(Verse 2)

20
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:11,010
Mountains fall and oceans rise,

21
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:13,722
time dissolves but reason lies

22
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:16,436
in symmetry that doesn’t fade,

23
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,149
the calm beneath the blade.

24
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:20,584
(Bridge – spoken over strings)

25
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:22,021
Every beat of every star

26
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,653
is distance from what things are.

27
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:27,527
All become, but One remains,

28
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:30,079
still heart inside the veins.

29
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:30,399
(Final Hook)

30
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,031
The Unmoved Mover, center of the spin,

31
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,584
axis where the worlds begin.

32
00:01:35,584 --> 00:01:38,138
Through every change, it stays akin—

33
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:41,329
motion born from what won’t bend.

34
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:44,361
motion born from what won’t bend.

35
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:54,894
(Outro – choir + piano fade)

36
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:18,032
Before the spark, before the sound,

37
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:23,298
the Unmoved Mover turns the round.
