1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,559
(intro — quiet, over bass hum)

2
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:01,915
Zero sat under the table,

3
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:05,984
counting the legs.

4
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:11,489
Every number wobbled a bit,

5
00:00:12,605 --> 00:00:14,521
pretending to know balance.

6
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:17,871
(verse 1)

7
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:20,185
People love what they can measure,

8
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:23,936
they hate what they can’t contain.

9
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,042
So they built cages out of calendars

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,552
and called that living again.

11
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:35,823
I said,

12
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:38,856
there’s motion inside your mirrors,

13
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:42,128
a pulse beneath your proof.

14
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:47,633
They nodded like tourists in a storm

15
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,426
— they never felt it move.

16
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,052
I am the breath between codes,

17
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:57,447
the slip inside precision,

18
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,680
the hush that turns to thunder

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,595
when you finally make a decision.

20
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,308
Every fact you worship

21
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:06,063
is a ghost wearing math.

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,855
Every god you whisper to

23
00:01:08,936 --> 00:01:10,531
just wants you to laugh.

24
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:15,239
So run with the pulse, don’t map it.

25
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:19,706
You can’t cage lightning, you trap it.

26
00:01:20,266 --> 00:01:23,697
Let it bite your logic in two —

27
00:01:23,537 --> 00:01:25,451
truth’s supposed to bruise you.

28
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,882
No halo, no crown, just fuse.

29
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:30,239
Zero’s alive.

30
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,149
You’ll know it

31
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:37,579
when the ground starts dancing under

32
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:39,334
your shoes.

33
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:54,813
Silence isn’t empty.

34
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,680
It’s the universe holding its breath.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,989
And somewhere in that pause,

36
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:08,138
Zero grins —

37
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:08,776
because finally,

38
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:10,052
finally,

39
00:02:13,004 --> 00:02:15,080
you felt it move.
