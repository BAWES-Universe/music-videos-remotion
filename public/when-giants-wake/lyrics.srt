00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:03,190
(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:05,027
In the still of the earth, when the ground holds its breath,

3
00:00:06,222 --> 00:00:11,010
You can feel the bones of the giants beneath.

4
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:19,867
They are not gone… only sleeping.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,324
I have walked where the mountains bow,

6
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,154
Where the rivers speak, where the skies know how

7
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:36,222
To hold their thunder till the hour is right,

8
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:41,409
Then split the dark with a blade of light.

9
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,840
Every step I take is an old drum's call,

10
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,228
Every shadow knows it, every wall will fall.

11
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:54,414
For the day is coming, I can hear the quake,

12
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,234
And the dust will rise… when the giants wake.

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,000
(CHORUS)

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,861
When the giants wake! (Oh-oh!)

15
00:01:06,861 --> 00:01:10,132
Feel the ground start to shake! (Oh-oh!)

16
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:13,323
Every chain's gonna break, every crown remade—

17
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:14,281
When the giants wake!

18
00:01:16,197 --> 00:01:18,989
From the deep they rise! (Oh-oh!)

19
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,021
With the fire in their eyes! (Oh-oh!)

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,888
No fear, no fate, no power can take—

21
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,888
What the giants make!

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,000
(VERSE 2)

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,233
They tried to write our names in sand,

24
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:36,063
Tried to steal the blood from our father's land.

25
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:40,052
But the roots run deeper than the hand can reach,

26
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,000
And the truth speaks louder than the lies they preach.

27
00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:49,149
I have seen the sparks in a million eyes,

28
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,058
Heard the marching storm when the people rise.

29
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:58,483
We are stones, we are storms, we are oceans wide,

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,983
We are every voice they can't divide.

31
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,000
(CHORUS)

32
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:10,133
When the giants wake! (Oh-oh!)

33
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,048
Feel the ground start to shake! (Oh-oh!)

34
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:17,153
Every chain's gonna break, every crown remade—

35
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:18,431
When the giants wake!

36
00:02:19,947 --> 00:02:22,818
From the deep they rise! (Oh-oh!)

37
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:25,850
With the fire in their eyes! (Oh-oh!)

38
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:30,717
No fear, no fate, no power can take—

39
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,717
What the giants make!

40
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:33,500
(BRIDGE)

41
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:36,782
Leader: Who will stand when the earth gives way?

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,096
Crowd: We will! We will!

43
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:42,686
Leader: Who will rise at the break of day?

44
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:44,919
Crowd: We will! We will!

45
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:50,903
Leader: When the mountains speak and the rivers roar—

46
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:56,967
All: We will march like the ones who came before!

47
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:03,000
(CHORUS)

48
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,063
When the giants wake! (Oh-oh!)

49
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:09,254
Feel the ground start to shake! (Oh-oh!)

50
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:12,526
Every chain's gonna break, every crown remade—

51
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,484
When the giants wake!

52
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:18,350
From the deep they rise! (Oh-oh!)

53
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,462
With the fire in their eyes! (Oh-oh!)

54
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:26,090
No fear, no fate, no power can take—

55
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,090
What the giants make!

56
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:29,000
(OUTRO)

57
00:03:28,802 --> 00:03:38,616
Wake… wake… when the giants wake…

58
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:41,649
Wake… wake… when the giants wake.
