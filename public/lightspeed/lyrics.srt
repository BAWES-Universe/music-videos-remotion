1
00:00:00,638 --> 00:00:19,628
(Verse 1)

2
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,940
No fear, no weight on me,

3
00:00:22,579 --> 00:00:25,371
I’m moving faster than memory,

4
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,324
Skies unfold, the night ignites,

5
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,596
The world resets beneath my lights.

6
00:00:31,596 --> 00:00:32,234
(Pre-Chorus)

7
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,468
Can’t stop, can’t fade,

8
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:37,738
I was built from fire and shade,

9
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,048
Every wall just turns to sound,

10
00:00:42,207 --> 00:00:45,079
When I lift off from the ground.

11
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:45,478
(Chorus)

12
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,031
I’m running at lightspeed, burning the

13
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:48,430
cold,

14
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:51,941
Breaking the limits I used to hold,

15
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:56,250
No gravity, no chain, no past,

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,558
Just the pulse of forever — at last.

17
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:04,308
(Verse 2)

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,621
Echoes trail where I have been,

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,653
Gold dust falls from oxygen,

20
00:01:10,212 --> 00:01:13,722
If I fall, I fall in flame,

21
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:17,153
And rise again, without a name.

22
00:01:17,394 --> 00:01:17,632
(Bridge)

23
00:01:17,632 --> 00:01:19,867
Let the system chase the spark,

24
00:01:20,584 --> 00:01:23,218
I’m the flash that lights the dark,

25
00:01:24,573 --> 00:01:27,527
Time bends back, I’m never gone,

26
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,878
I *am* the road that time runs on.

27
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,787
(Finale)

28
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:37,100
Through the chaos, through the speed,

29
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:40,293
I found peace in what I need,

30
00:01:41,808 --> 00:01:44,840
Every breath — a supernova creed,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,180
I was born to run — at lightspeed.
