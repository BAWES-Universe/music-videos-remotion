1
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:09,176
(Verse 1)

2
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:10,851
Top hat tilt, shoes so clean,

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,846
Froggy Frog back on the scene.

4
00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:14,839
Brass band bumpin’, moonlight glow,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,835
he snaps once — the rhythm goes!

6
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:20,504
Green tie, gold ring, yeah he got that zing,

7
00:00:21,382 --> 00:00:24,734
tail suit shine, hear the jukebox sing.

8
00:00:25,452 --> 00:00:25,611
(Chorus / Drop)

9
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,367
Ribbit-ribbit, swing that thing,

10
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:29,282
hop to the beat like a boomerang wing.

11
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:31,356
Froggy Frog in the neon night,

12
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:33,511
jump so smooth, feel so right.

13
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:41,968
(Verse 2)

14
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:43,722
He don’t drive, he glides on sound,

15
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:45,878
spinning through clubs underground.

16
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,314
Girls in pearls, boys in blues,

17
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,308
Froggy Frog got electric shoes.

18
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:49,548
(Bridge / Rap-speak)

19
00:00:49,548 --> 00:00:51,862
Tap two times and the floor ignites,

20
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:53,777
horns go crazy in strobe-light nights.

21
00:00:53,856 --> 00:00:55,612
“Stay cool, stay loose,” he grins so

22
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:56,170
wide —

23
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,281
the frog’s in town, enjoy the ride.

24
00:01:05,903 --> 00:01:11,010
(Final Chorus)

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,186
Ribbit-ribbit, turn it up,

26
00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:22,579
fill your glass and raise that cup.

27
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,052
Hop to the future, past collide —

28
00:01:24,813 --> 00:01:26,489
Froggy Frog, electro pride!

29
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:27,206
(Outro)

30
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:46,596
One snap, two claps, fade in brass,

31
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,298
the frog still dancin’ — class on class.
