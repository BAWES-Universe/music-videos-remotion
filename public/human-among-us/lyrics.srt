1
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:14,839
If the divine wore skin and bones…

2
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:15,878
Where would they walk?

3
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:23,936
Would they sit in marble halls…

4
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:26,170
Or sleep under broken walls?

5
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,435
Maybe they’d show up barefoot,

6
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:33,350
Dust on their clothes, truth in their throat,

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,744
Not a crown, not a throne, just a hunger

8
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,819
For justice that burns like smoke.

9
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,329
Maybe they’d be in the camps,

10
00:00:41,569 --> 00:00:43,244
Where the ground shakes when the sky

11
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,042
drops fire,

12
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:46,356
Holding a child who don’t know why

13
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,670
Their only lullaby is the sound of sirens.

14
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:54,573
Would you allow this? On your kid’s bed?

15
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:58,722
Would you excuse it? If it was your

16
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:59,521
blood shed?

17
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:03,511
Aren’t we cousins, same tree, same

18
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:03,988
roots,

19
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:08,777
Adam and Eve, yeah, the story’s in the

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,254
fruit.

21
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,361
If flesh carried love unshaken,

22
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:16,277
Would we embrace it or break it?

23
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:18,031
Would we listen or fake it?

24
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:20,665
Or crucify truth when we can’t take it?

25
00:01:20,823 --> 00:01:22,500
They’d be found in the alleys,

26
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,132
Not in palaces with gates,

27
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,926
Feeding mouths the world abandoned,

28
00:01:28,644 --> 00:01:30,239
Calling out the hand of hate.

29
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:35,745
Would you allow this? On your kid’s bed?

30
00:01:35,745 --> 00:01:39,176
Would you excuse it? If it was your

31
00:01:39,176 --> 00:01:39,972
blood shed?

32
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,043
Aren’t we cousins, same tree, same

33
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:44,600
roots,

34
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,228
Adam and Eve, yeah, the story’s in the

35
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:49,706
fruit.

36
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,334
This is not religion.

37
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:56,489
This is not war.

38
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,281
This is children crying

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,117
Behind shattered doors.

40
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:02,871
This is silence screaming

41
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,861
From a world gone numb.

42
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,335
This is distant cousins

43
00:02:10,691 --> 00:02:12,287
Forgetting where they’re from.

44
00:02:13,484 --> 00:02:14,919
If the sacred wore skin,

45
00:02:15,956 --> 00:02:17,394
It would bleed like ours,

46
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:20,026
It would sleep under stars,

47
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,500
It would break behind bars.

48
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,052
And the question would echo,

49
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,526
Like a voice in your head:

50
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:30,000
*Would you allow this for your kids?*

51
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:32,234
Or would you stand instead?

52
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:50,265
Until you see every child as your own…

53
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:52,739
You’ve not understood love.
