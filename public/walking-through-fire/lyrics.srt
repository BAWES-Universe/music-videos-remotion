00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:21,463
🔥 Verse 1

2
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:23,536
I was afraid of the heat,

3
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:29,920
’til I found myself dancing in it.

4
00:00:31,036 --> 00:00:34,228
The world said, “That’s hell, don’t go!

5
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:35,345
”

6
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:38,137
But I said, “That’s where I’ll finish

7
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,734
it.”

8
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:39,734
🌬️ Chorus

9
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,968
’Cause walking through fire feels like

10
00:00:41,968 --> 00:00:42,527
flying,

11
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:45,079
when you stop running from the burn.

12
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,792
Every scar is a sunrise shining,

13
00:00:47,951 --> 00:00:50,027
every fall is a way to learn.

14
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,500
Freedom isn’t found in the garden —

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,814
it’s born in the smoke and the storm.

16
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:58,484
Walking through fire —

17
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,319
I’ve never felt so warm.

18
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:17,712
🔥 Verse 2

19
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:21,302
The ashes kiss my feet like rivers,

20
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:26,728
the air tastes clean and wild.

21
00:01:28,165 --> 00:01:30,798
Heaven was never the prize,

22
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:36,861
the journey was the child.

23
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:37,021
🌬️ Chorus

24
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:44,043
Walking through fire feels like flying,

25
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,277
when you stop running from the burn.

26
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,989
Every scar is a sunrise shining,

27
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:51,302
every fall is a way to learn.

28
00:01:51,382 --> 00:01:53,456
Freedom isn’t safe — it’s living.

29
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:55,930
It’s the scream that becomes a song.

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,000
Walking through fire —

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,754
and laughing all along.

32
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:03,031
🔥 Bridge

33
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:09,813
No savior’s hand, no golden gate,

34
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:14,840
just me and the spark of fate.

35
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:21,543
If heaven’s real, it waits inside —

36
00:02:20,824 --> 00:02:26,649
beyond the fear we tried to hide.

37
00:02:26,888 --> 00:02:30,558
🌅 Final Chorus

38
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:32,951
Walking through fire feels like flying,

39
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,265
when your soul remembers the flame.

40
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:37,739
Heaven and hell — they’re just mirrors,

41
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,813
and I’m not scared of my name.

42
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,287
Freedom’s not after — it’s now, it’s

43
00:02:42,925 --> 00:02:43,324
here,

44
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,798
it’s in the burning clear.

45
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:59,201
Walking through fire —

46
00:02:58,723 --> 00:03:00,558
I disappear.
