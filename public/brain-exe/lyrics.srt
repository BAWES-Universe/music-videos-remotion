1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,878
(INTRO)

2
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:03,112
shhh— load that code.

3
00:00:03,112 --> 00:00:04,628
brain.exe in overload.

4
00:00:04,786 --> 00:00:06,302
static breath — can’t feel no mode,

5
00:00:06,302 --> 00:00:08,217
I write like wires in battle mode.

6
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,446
Tick-tick— pause — mind skip, replay.

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,121
Clock hand talk, but I don’t obey.

8
00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:15,878
Glitch that thought, I bend cliché,

9
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,553
Words too sharp — they cut delay.

10
00:00:17,632 --> 00:00:19,149
They code truth, I speak bug,

11
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:20,984
Half in love, half unplugged.

12
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:22,579
You rap sane — I rap shrug,

13
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:24,574
You write rhymes — I write drugs.

14
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:27,128
Ha! Brain spark, line arcs, aim off

15
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:27,925
— still mark!

16
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:30,079
Wrong note, right pitch, bass bite, full

17
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:30,478
spark.

18
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:32,154
Mind don’t talk — it hums in volts,

19
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:33,829
Every idea born with faults.

20
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:35,585
Break that beat — I skip my line,

21
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:37,261
Trip my word — it still sound fine.

22
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,856
I lose time but I gain design,

23
00:00:38,856 --> 00:00:40,771
My error code? Divine sign.

24
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,121
I’m the glitch you can’t delete!

25
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:44,121

26
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:46,515
Hear my pulse beneath the beat!

27
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:49,228
Brain.exe — repeat, repeat,

28
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:51,064
Crash, revive, complete, complete.

29
00:00:51,064 --> 00:00:52,659
Back to base, face half-lit,

30
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,176
Every thought got static grit.

31
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:56,250
Say I’m mad? I call it fit.

32
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,926
You dream normal — I dream split.

33
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,840
hah— breathe in noise, exhale math,

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,755
syntax bleed on the poet’s path.

35
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:03,511
word file cracked, I laugh,

36
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:04,947
mad genius — do the math.

37
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:06,781
shh… load complete.

38
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,218
memory clean.

39
00:01:09,016 --> 00:01:10,691
system saved —

40
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:11,409
…but who saved me?

41
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:14,201
I’m the glitch you can’t delete!

42
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:14,201

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,951
Hear my pulse beneath the beat!

44
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,346
Brain.exe — repeat, repeat,

45
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:27,439
Crash, revive, complete, complete.
