(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:25,850
Unveil my mask of might

3
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,803
Hidden face tonight

4
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,675
Pardon my rage inside

5
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:34,387
Turned to steel

6
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:36,941
These hands

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,058
These fists

8
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:39,654
The pain

9
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,170
The bliss

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,845
The strength

11
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:43,963
The loss

12
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,718
I am the boss

13

(CHORUS)

14
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,984
I can feel my body being drained

15
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:56,649
Re-energize when I see you again

16
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:08,298
(Just) a part of me remains

17
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:21,500
(CHORUS)

18
00:01:21,462 --> 00:01:24,813
I can feel my body being drained

19
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:30,478
Re-energize when I see you again

20
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:55,200
(VERSE 2)

21
00:01:55,132 --> 00:01:55,930
These hands

22
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:57,048
These fists

23
00:01:57,926 --> 00:01:58,722
The pain

24
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:00,159
The bliss

25
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:01,834
The strength

26
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:02,951
The loss

27
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,628
I am the boss

28
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:06,750
(CHORUS)

29
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:10,052
I can feel my body being drained

30
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,717
Re-energize when I see you again
