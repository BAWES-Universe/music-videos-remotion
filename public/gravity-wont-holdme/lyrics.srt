1
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:25,213
(Verse 1)

2
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:27,047
Caught between the pull and flight,

3
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,472
Fire below and stars in sight,

4
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:38,137
I was born from dust and flame,

5
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:43,244
Built to break and rise again.

6
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:45,478
(Pre-Chorus)

7
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,191
Every fall just feeds the climb,

8
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,621
Every scar rewrites the time,

9
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,697
I’m not bound by what they see,

10
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,488
I’m the force that set me free.

11
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:57,286
(Chorus)

12
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,914
Gravity won’t hold me down,

13
00:01:02,314 --> 00:01:04,706
Sky’s my heart, the earth’s my sound,

14
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,340
Every motion breaks the chain,

15
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,293
I’m the storm that breathes again.

16
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:20,983
(Verse 2)

17
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,962
Hands of light, the world unfolds,

18
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:34,468
Silver dreams and fields of gold,

19
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:42,766
Every turn, I feel it still —

20
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,399
The universe bends to my will.

21
00:01:46,915 --> 00:01:47,712
(Bridge)

22
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:50,027
Let the cosmos spin in fire,

23
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:52,978
Fuel the pulse of my desire,

24
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,972
If time should fall, I’ll still be

25
00:01:55,052 --> 00:01:55,531
found,

26
00:01:55,691 --> 00:01:58,403
Where the echoes shake the ground.

27
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:02,073
(Finale)

28
00:02:01,197 --> 00:02:03,430
Gravity won’t hold me down,

29
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:06,063
Every loss becomes my crown,

30
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:09,495
I was never made to stay —

31
00:02:09,015 --> 00:02:15,080
I was born to break away.
