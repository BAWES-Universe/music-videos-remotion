1
00:00:00,878 --> 00:00:03,032
Yo, step through the glass —

2
00:00:02,713 --> 00:00:04,706
反射 (hansha) hits back like a bassline

3
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:05,185
blast.

4
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,020
Petals in the air, light bends like a

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:07,261
sin,

6
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,776
Welcome to the mirror garden — let the

7
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:09,653
story begin.

8
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,887
I’m the glasswalker, bending every

9
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:12,446
reflection,

10
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,521
Flipping universes in a single

11
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:15,000
direction.

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,754
花が咲く (hana ga saku) where the beat drops

13
00:00:16,914 --> 00:00:17,393
twice,

14
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,468
Parallel paths, rollin’ mirrored dice.

15
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:22,100
Shards of the moon in the koi pond shimmer,

16
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,335
Truth cuts deep in the silver-glass glimmer.

17
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:26,410
Every step’s a glitch, every move’s a code,

18
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,403
I’m the gardener of echoes on a mirrored

22
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:28,803
road.

23
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:32,314
鏡の庭 (kagami no niwa) — where the real

24
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:32,951
collides,

25
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:37,579
Infinite doors in the place that hides.

26
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:42,366
Step in once and you’ll never come back,

27
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:46,595
I’m the phoenix in the glass with a

28
00:00:46,595 --> 00:00:47,633
flame on track.

29
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:58,722
Yo, I spit kanji like they’re ninja

30
00:00:58,802 --> 00:00:59,281
stars,

31
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:01,197
Cutting through lies, breaking prison

32
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:01,595
bars.

33
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,430
影が踊る (kage ga odoru) when the bassline

34
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,670
drops,

35
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:06,063
Every rhyme’s a blossom that the timeline crops.

36
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:08,218
I plant seeds in the cracks of the

38
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:08,697
frame,

39
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:10,451
Watch them bloom in the heat of the

40
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:10,850
game.

41
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,686
The mirror don’t lie but it talks in

42
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,004
code,

43
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:14,600
If you read between the lines, you can

44
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,319
change the mode.

45
00:01:15,798 --> 00:01:18,909
鏡の庭 (kagami no niwa) — where the real

46
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:19,548
collides,

47
00:01:20,903 --> 00:01:23,855
Infinite doors in the place that hides.

48
00:01:23,936 --> 00:01:28,962
Step in once and you’ll never come back,

49
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:33,191
I’m the phoenix in the glass with a

50
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:34,228
flame on track.

51
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,686
Bend the hourglass, break the hands of

52
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,084
time.

53
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,239
Every petal’s a key, every stem’s a map,

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,073
And the garden’s the stage where I lay

55
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:02,472
my trap.

56
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,861
Yo, reflection bends, perception blends,

57
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,697
This is where beginnings twist into

58
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:09,096
ends.

59
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,770
The mirror is the mic, and the beat’s

60
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,250
the seed,

61
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,245
In the garden of infinity — I plant what

62
00:02:13,245 --> 00:02:14,122
you need.
