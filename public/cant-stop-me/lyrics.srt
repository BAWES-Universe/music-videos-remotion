1
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:09,894
(Verse 1)

2
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,887
Raid my office, raid my home,

3
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:16,036
kidnap the echoes of my tone.

4
00:00:17,952 --> 00:00:20,265
Burn my pages, break my pen —

5
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:22,181
I’ll just write it all again.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,378
(Pre-Chorus)

7
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:28,245
You think silence means you won —

8
00:00:28,004 --> 00:00:30,160
but I’ve got thunder in my lungs.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,797
(Hook)

10
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:37,738
Can’t stop me — I’m the wind through

11
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:38,218
stone.

12
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,409
Can’t block me — I’m already home.

13
00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:46,515
Every fire you start just shows

14
00:00:46,676 --> 00:00:51,701
how bright I grow —

15
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,978
you can’t stop me.

16
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:57,686
(Verse 2)

17
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:00,718
Spread your rumors, twist my name,

18
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,787
feed your fear, it tastes the same.

19
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,777
I built my truth from heat and sand,

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,611
it lives in more than one man’s hand.

21
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:12,846
(Bridge – spoken over drums)

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,111
Erase my face, it comes in waves.

23
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,180
Bury my light, it burns through grave

24
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:22,739
s.

25
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:23,936
Every time you pull the thread,

26
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,409
the flag just flies instead.

27
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:29,521
(Final Hook)

28
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:33,350
Can’t stop me — I rise from flame.

29
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,701
Can’t drop me — I rename the game.

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,972
You took my stage, I made the street.

31
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:44,521
You took my voice — I found the beat.

32
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:51,861
Can’t stop me —

33
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:52,899
I’m free.
