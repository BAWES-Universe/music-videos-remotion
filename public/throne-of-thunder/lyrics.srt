1
00:00:00,957 --> 00:00:06,463
I rise in the hush before the storm can

2
00:00:06,621 --> 00:00:07,100
speak,

3
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:15,319
Gold in my veins, fire under my feet.

4
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:22,739
Every breath is a drum, every step is a

5
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:23,217
crown,

6
00:00:24,653 --> 00:00:30,000
I was made for the sky, I was forged for

7
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,036
the sound.

8
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,021
I’ve walked on the edges where the brave

9
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:37,738
don’t go,

10
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:40,691
Where the night pulls close and the cold

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,569
winds blow.

12
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:44,362
I’ve carried the weight that could break

13
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:45,159
a spine,

14
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,350
Turned every scar to a battle sign.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,500
You can’t dim a sun that was born to ign

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:52,738
ite,

17
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:56,170
Can’t drown a tide when it’s already

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:56,649
night.

19
00:00:56,728 --> 00:00:59,362
I’m the spark in the dark, I’m the storm

20
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:00,159
set free,

21
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:02,633
When the gates swing wide, they’ll

22
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:03,590
remember me.

23
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:07,100
I sit on a throne of thunder,

24
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:11,010
Every strike’s a hymn, every roar’s my

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:11,808
number.

26
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:14,600
Raise your hands, feel the heavens

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,159
break,

28
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:18,111
We were born for the fire, let the whole

29
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,069
world shake.

30
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:37,100
I’ve seen crowns fall to the dust and

31
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,659
fade,

32
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,531
Seen kings lose thrones they thought

33
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,409
they made.

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,079
But I don’t bow and I don’t chase gold,

35
00:01:45,878 --> 00:01:48,750
I am the story the prophets told.

36
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:51,941
My blood is a river, my voice a flame,

37
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:56,329
I’m the echo that carries a holy name.

38
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,680
Every fall was a step, every step was a

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,159
climb,

40
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,430
Now the peak is mine, and the bell will

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:03,750
chime.

42
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,100
I sit on a throne of thunder,

43
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:11,010
Every strike’s a hymn, every roar’s my

44
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:11,729
number.

45
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,441
Raise your hands, feel the heavens

46
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,080
break,

47
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:18,111
We were born for the fire, let the whole

48
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:32,793
world shake.

49
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:37,899
Leader: Can you feel it in your chest?

50
00:02:38,377 --> 00:02:41,169
Choir: Yes we can! Yes we can!

51
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,000
Leader: Will you stand through the test?

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,510
Choir: Yes we can! Yes we can!

53
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,462
Leader: When the night turns red and the

54
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,096
sky rains light—

55
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:57,846
All: We will rise, we will fight, we

56
00:02:57,846 --> 00:03:00,479
will burn so bright!

57
00:03:04,149 --> 00:03:07,100
I sit on a throne of thunder,

58
00:03:08,058 --> 00:03:11,010
Every strike’s a hymn, every roar’s my

59
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:11,729
number.

60
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,441
Raise your hands, feel the heavens

61
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:15,159
break,

62
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:18,111
We were born for the fire, let the whole

63
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:18,909
world shake.

64
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:22,659
This is the sound of the crown I claim,

65
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:30,638
Written in lightning, carved in flame.
