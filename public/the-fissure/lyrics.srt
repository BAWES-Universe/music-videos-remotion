1
00:00:01,675 --> 00:00:07,600
(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,734
Pressure in my chest made a hairline split,

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,410
whole damn world tried to box my wit.

4
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,244
Voice went quiet but the pulse went lit,

5
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:15,000
crack in the mind, now the thoughts don't fit.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,754
Didn't ask life for a script or a guide,

7
00:00:16,754 --> 00:00:18,589
I just felt steel start forming inside.

8
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:20,346
Fear took one step back when I tried,

9
00:00:20,346 --> 00:00:22,021
courage found room where the fracture applied.

10
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:22,181
(PRE-CHORUS)

11
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:23,536
That fissure — turned me clean,

12
00:00:23,536 --> 00:00:25,292
cut my noise till the core went mean.

13
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,888
That fissure — split unseen,

14
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:28,722
broke my doubt with a silent beam.

15
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:30,239
That fissure — cold routine,

16
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,073
made my calm into gasoline.

17
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,069
That fissure — shift machine,

18
00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:35,904
I made pain into discipline.

19
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:36,701
(VERSE 2)

20
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:38,137
Everything snapped but I stayed intact,

21
00:00:38,218 --> 00:00:39,893
mind rearranged like a silent pact.

22
00:00:40,052 --> 00:00:41,728
Truth got loud when the lies got cracked,

23
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,564
I saw who I am when the mask collapsed.

24
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,399
Step by step with a brand-new stance,

25
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,234
old hesitation never stood a chance.

26
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,988
Life threw heat but I learned to advance,

27
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:50,585
fractured once, now I cut through trance.

28
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:51,781
(BRIDGE)

29
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:53,298
Quiet break… loud result.

30
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,808
One small fault… made me adult.

31
00:00:57,048 --> 00:01:00,238
Quiet break… loud result.

32
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:02,871
One small fault… made me adult.

33
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:04,947
(CHORUS)

34
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:06,462
That fissure — turned me clean,

35
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:08,218
cut my noise till the core went mean.

36
00:01:08,456 --> 00:01:09,894
That fissure — split unseen,

37
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:11,728
broke my doubt with a silent beam.

38
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:13,644
That fissure — shift machine,

39
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,399
I made pain into gasoline.
