1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,435
They told me pay the fee,

2
00:00:02,472 --> 00:00:04,628
Fifty months, maybe a hundred, just to

3
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:05,266
breathe.

4
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:07,261
Call it honor, call it pride,

5
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:09,494
But it feels like chains dressed up in

6
00:00:09,573 --> 00:00:10,053
white.

7
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:14,121
Bank account bleeding in the name of a vow,

8
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:16,995
Triple the expenses, who’s laughing now?

10
00:00:17,314 --> 00:00:19,867
Voices in my ear, say “live like this,

11
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:20,824
not that,”

12
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,339
But no matter what I give, they say it

13
00:00:22,339 --> 00:00:23,457
ain’t enough back.

14
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,931
Is it love or illusion, a contract for

15
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:26,250
pain?

16
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,245
Or a ticket to a circus where the clowns

17
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:28,963
wear rings?

18
00:00:29,202 --> 00:00:31,596
If freedom costs less than forever in debt,

19
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,548
Then I’ll take the silence, keep my dignity instead.

20
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:38,218
Price of love — too high, I can’t buy.

23
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:43,085
All these rules, just a cage in

24
00:00:43,404 --> 00:00:44,121
disguise.

25
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,871
If the measure of my heart is the weight

26
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,069
of my gold,

27
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,984
I’d rather die free than be bartered and

28
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,222
sold.

29
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,883
They say it’s for sex, they say it’s for

30
00:00:58,883 --> 00:00:59,281
life,

31
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:01,676
But the math don’t add up to joy or

32
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:02,154
light.

33
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:03,988
If keeping someone close means I’m

34
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:05,105
breaking my spine,

35
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,340
Then maybe love’s a prison I’ll never

36
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:07,819
sign.

37
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,771
What if I want a partner, not a chain?

38
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,165
What if I want the fire without the

39
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:13,563
pain?

40
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:16,596
What if I’d give my soul for someone

41
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:17,394
true —

42
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:19,787
But not my freedom, not my truth?

43
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,250
Price of love — too high, I can’t buy.

44
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:31,037
All these rules, just a cage in

45
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:32,153
disguise.

46
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,903
If the measure of my heart is the weight

47
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:36,701
of my gold,

48
00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:39,096
I’d rather die free than be bartered and

49
00:01:39,096 --> 00:01:39,495
sold.

50
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:47,233
Keep your illusion, keep your crown,

51
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:49,787
I’ll keep my dignity underground.

52
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,819
Love should lift, not bleed me dry,

53
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:55,052
I won’t trade my wings just to say

54
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,329
goodbye.
