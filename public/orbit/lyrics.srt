00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,239
(INTRO)

2
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:01,197
Nobody stopped.

3
00:00:01,995 --> 00:00:03,511
The universe doesn't pause.

4
00:00:04,706 --> 00:00:05,665
So I moved with it.

5
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,005
(VERSE 1)

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:15,398
Crowds still moving when I step outside,

7
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,871
systems humming like they never died.

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,745
I'm not special — I just stayed alive,

9
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:23,457
learned how to move when the lanes collide.

10
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,568
People got routes, people got roles,

11
00:00:27,286 --> 00:00:29,440
everyone circling something they know.

12
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,995
I don't fight it, I let it unfold,

13
00:00:32,154 --> 00:00:34,149
find my line in the pull and go.

14
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:35,744
(PRE-CHORUS)

15
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:37,100
In orbit —

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,058
not lost, not free.

17
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,734
In orbit —

18
00:00:39,972 --> 00:00:41,011
this is where I need to be.

19
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,765
In orbit —

20
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:45,718
close enough to feel the heat,

21
00:00:45,798 --> 00:00:46,277
far enough to still breathe.

22
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:47,314
In orbit —

23
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:48,350
not lost, not free.

24
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,064
In orbit —

25
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:52,261
this is where I need to be.

26
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,095
In orbit —

27
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:55,900
close enough to feel the heat,

28
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,207
far enough to still breathe.

29
00:00:59,201 --> 00:00:59,362
(VERSE 2)

30
00:00:59,362 --> 00:01:01,835
I see hands building what eyes don't show,

31
00:01:02,472 --> 00:01:04,706
quiet work in a constant flow.

32
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,500
No applause when the system holds,

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,371
just motion proving that it knows.

34
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,165
I don't drift, I don't run ahead,

35
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:15,798
I match the pace of what's being said.

36
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:18,510
Universe loud, but it don't beg,

37
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,180
it keeps turning — so I step in.

38
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:24,096
We don't lead.

39
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,968
We don't wait.

40
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:29,600
We align.

41
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,712
We rotate.

42
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,027
(CHORUS)

43
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:36,382
In orbit —

44
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:37,420
not lost, not free.

45
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,016
In orbit —

46
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:40,293
this is where I need to be.

47
00:01:40,293 --> 00:01:42,048
In orbit —

48
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:43,500
close enough to feel the heat,

49
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,600
far enough to still breathe.

50
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,079
(CHORUS)

51
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,355
In orbit —

52
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:47,472
not lost, not free.

53
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:48,191
In orbit —

54
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,426
this is where I need to be.

55
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:51,543
In orbit —

56
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:53,456
close enough to feel the heat,

57
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:56,728
far enough to still breathe.
