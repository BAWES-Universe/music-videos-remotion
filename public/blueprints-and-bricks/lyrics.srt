1
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,160
(Hook – Male + Female)

2
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:19,468
They want the blueprint, never laid no

3
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,265
brick,

4
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:23,936
Talk like wolves, but they move like

5
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:24,495
tricks.

6
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:28,004
You want the crown? Then carry the

7
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:29,202
weight

8
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:32,552
Can’t bend time if you fold to fate.

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:37,899
Lay the stone... hold the line...

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:46,036
Not all fire means it’s time...

11
00:00:50,265 --> 00:00:52,579
They show up loud, but the call is weak,

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,176
Hands stay clean, but their mouths still

13
00:00:54,176 --> 00:00:54,494
speak.

14
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:56,649
No scars, no sweat, no cuts, no stakes

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:56,808
—

16
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,323
Still tryna eat off someone else’s

17
00:00:58,404 --> 00:00:58,802
plate.

18
00:00:58,802 --> 00:01:00,558
I don’t post plans — I engrave 'em in

19
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:01,036
steel,

20
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:02,951
What I bleed, they pretend to feel.

21
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:04,867
Spoke of "team" but ducked the drill,

22
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,543
I built ten worlds — they flinched at

23
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:06,941
the hill.

24
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,573
They want the blueprint, never laid no

25
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:10,293
brick,

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,722
Talk like wolves, but they move like

27
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:13,882
tricks.

28
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:18,111
You want the crown? Then carry the

29
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:19,388
weight

30
00:01:19,308 --> 00:01:22,659
Can’t bend time if you fold to fate.

31
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:28,004
Lay the stone... hold the line...

32
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:35,504
Storms don’t wait. Clocks don’t lie...

33
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:40,531
(Verse 2 – Male, colder)

34
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,447
Ran from the cold, then called it wise,

35
00:01:42,766 --> 00:01:44,521
I stood still while they memorized lies.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,676
Blueprints folded in a fist on fire,

37
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,510
I build through sleep, I cut through

38
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,829
wire.

39
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,302
No gods, no masters, no holy script —

40
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:53,058
Just nails, dust, and a tightened grip.

41
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:55,293
You want in? Then break your shell —

42
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,808
Or stay out there with the rest who

43
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:56,968
yell.

44
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,680
They want the blueprint, never laid no

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,399
brick,

46
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:03,989
Talk like wolves, but they move like

47
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,628
tricks.

48
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:08,138
You want the crown? Then carry the

49
00:02:08,217 --> 00:02:09,414
weight

50
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:12,686
Can’t bend time if you fold to fate.

51
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:18,191
Lay the stone... hold the line...

52
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:26,250
Storms don’t wait. Clocks don’t lie...
