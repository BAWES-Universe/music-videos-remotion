1
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:12,048
Mmm… yeah…

2
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:14,282
Step into the room and the floor turns

3
00:00:14,282 --> 00:00:14,680
gold,

4
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:18,670
Every heartbeat telling me to take

5
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:19,867
control.

6
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:24,814
They can dim the stage but they can’t

7
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:25,771
dim me,

8
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,318
I was born for the moment, I was made to

9
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:31,196
be free.

10
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:36,701
Drums in my chest like a war in bloom,

11
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,015
Every step I take is a throne in the

12
00:00:39,015 --> 00:00:39,414
room.

13
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:42,366
Skin like fire, voice like rain,

14
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,920
Every move a prayer, every note a chain

15
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,871
Breaking loose in the dark till the light breaks through,

16
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:49,866
I’m the wind in the storm, I’m the sun

17
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:50,505
in the hue.

18
00:00:50,823 --> 00:00:52,819
Every crown they took, I built my own,

20
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,494
With the love, with the fight, with the

21
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:55,451
seeds I’ve sown.

22
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,643
This is my crown of light, I wear it

23
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:59,121
high,

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,308
Shining through the fire, I electrify.

25
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:09,733
They can try to break my stride, I won’t

26
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:10,293
fall,

27
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:17,000
Hear the sound of my name when I stand tall.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,426
They wrote my ending in invisible ink,

30
00:01:20,745 --> 00:01:22,819
But the words came alive when I started

31
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,456
to think.

32
00:01:23,697 --> 00:01:25,771
Every "no" they threw was a brick in the

33
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,170
wall,

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,323
But I danced on the top, never feared

35
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:28,882
the fall.

36
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:30,798
I’ve been the flame, I’ve been the

37
00:01:30,798 --> 00:01:31,277
spark,

38
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:33,670
I’ve been the lantern in the endless

39
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,069
dark.

40
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:36,222
Now my song is the flood that can’t be

41
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:36,621
denied,

42
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:39,334
Every note a wave, every wave a tide.

43
00:01:39,653 --> 00:01:43,165
This is my crown of light, I wear it

44
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:43,722
high,

45
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,745
Shining through the fire, I electrify.

46
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:54,415
They can try to break my stride, I won’t

47
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:54,972
fall,

48
00:01:55,212 --> 00:02:01,500
Hear the sound of my name when I stand tall.

49
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,579
Oh, you feel that heat when the truth

51
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:08,456
walks in,

52
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:13,802
Every shadow fades when the soul begins.

53
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,675
We don’t bow, we don’t break, we don’t

54
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:17,234
run away,

55
00:02:17,234 --> 00:02:19,068
We don’t bow, we don’t break, we don’t

56
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:19,467
run away,

57
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:23,058
We just lift up the sky till it shines

58
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,096
like day.

59
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:27,925
This is my crown of light, I wear it

60
00:02:28,004 --> 00:02:28,403
high,

61
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,669
Shining through the fire, I electrify.

62
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:39,015
They can try to break my stride, I won’t

63
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:39,574
fall,

64
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:46,500
Hear the sound of my name when I stand tall.

65
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:58,004
Mmm… my crown… my crown of light…

67
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:03,590
I wear it high…

68
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,947
I wear it high…
