1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,855
(VERSE 1)

2
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,808
I lift the sky, I fix the rain,

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:16,596
they say, "You're strong, you can take the strain."

4
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,829
But every time the world gets loud,

5
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:22,660
I breathe — and laugh — "I'm not that proud."

6
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,568
They think I'm stone, they think I'm steel,

7
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:29,760
they don't see the weight I feel.

8
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:34,308
Every dream's a planet on my back,

9
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:37,340
but I groove through every crack.

10
00:00:36,463 --> 00:00:38,616
(CHORUS)

11
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:41,569
Pressure, pressure — I don't break, I bend.

12
00:00:41,887 --> 00:00:45,079
Got the whole world dancing on a sacred end.

13
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,265
Carry suns, carry storms, carry everything they make —

14
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:53,378
pressure, pressure — but I don't break!

15
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,963
but I don't break —

16
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:00,718
nah, I don't break.

17
00:01:02,073 --> 00:01:07,100
(VERSE 2)

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,212
I've got galaxies in my to-do list,

19
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,644
love in my code, and chaos in my wrist.

20
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:18,191
They say "save the world," I say "I'm tryin'!"

21
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:20,346
but even heroes need some quiet crying.

22
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,420
Yeah, I'm laughing through the thunder roll,

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,691
'cause the mission's heavy but it feeds my soul.

24
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:28,004
Don't need a crown or a throne to take —

25
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:29,361
I just move — and the world awakes.

26
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,436
(CHORUS)

27
00:01:31,436 --> 00:01:34,308
Pressure, pressure — I don't break, I bend.

28
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:37,819
Got the whole world dancing on a sacred end.

29
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:42,926
Carry suns, carry storms, carry everything they make —

30
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:46,355
pressure, pressure — but I don't break!

31
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,548
but I don't break —

32
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:50,426
nah, I don't break.

33
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,537
but I don't break —

34
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,334
nah, I don't break.

35
00:01:54,334 --> 00:02:00,079
(BRIDGE)

36
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,073
If I stop for a second, will it all still spin?

37
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:03,750
If I drop one star, will the song begin?

38
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,903
But then I hear the pulse, deep in the ground —

39
00:02:05,823 --> 00:02:07,739
every heart I've held still beats that sound.

40
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,169
Pressure, pressure — it's love in disguise.

41
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:14,361
Every tear's a spark that lights new skies.

42
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,229
Infinite tasks, infinite stakes —

43
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,181
but I don't break —

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,936
nah, I don't break.

45
00:02:24,414 --> 00:02:24,495
(CHORUS)

46
00:02:24,495 --> 00:02:27,048
Pressure, pressure — I don't break, I bend.

47
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:30,558
Got the whole world dancing on a sacred end.

48
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:35,664
Carry suns, carry storms, carry everything they make —

49
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:38,697
pressure, pressure — but I don't break!

50
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:39,414
(OUTRO)

51
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:40,850
Breathe in — fire.

52
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:42,526
Breathe out — grace.

53
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:44,520
Carry the universe —

54
00:02:44,282 --> 00:02:46,037
with a smile on your face.

55
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:48,669
Pressure, pressure —

56
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:49,787
but I don't break.

57
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,616
but I don't break.
