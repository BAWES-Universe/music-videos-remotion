[00:00.63](VERSE 1)
[00:23.93]I was born from dust and duty,
[00:29.76]Built by hands that learned to break,
[00:35.98]Every scar became my blueprint,
[00:41.80]Every failure shaped my faith.
[00:47.71](PRE-CHORUS)
[00:47.95]I don’t move fast — I move right,
[00:50.66]One task, one truth, one light.
[00:54.57](CHORUS)
[00:54.73]Brick by brick, I breathe, I rise,
[01:00.87]Heart of work beneath the skies.
[01:05.02]When the world forgets its name,
[01:07.89]I remember — I remain.
[01:16.11](VERSE 2)
[01:16.19]Weight and pressure are my teachers,
[01:22.10]Fire carves the lines of grace,
[01:27.92]Time bends slow beneath my fingers,
[01:33.67]Stone remembers every face.
[01:40.13](PRE-CHORUS)
[01:40.53]Not a cog, not a slave — I build,
[01:46.27]Every pulse, a world fulfilled.
[01:53.77](CHORUS)
[01:54.01]Brick by brick, I breathe, I rise,
[01:57.12]Heart of work beneath the skies.
[02:00.23]Every rhythm, every strain,
[02:02.95]Feeds the pulse that breaks the chain.
[02:12.60](BRIDGE)
[02:12.76]Hear the ticking, hammer’s hymn,
[02:15.47]Where endings start and starts begin.
[02:18.59]Through the dust, the heart still drums
[02:21.54]—
[02:21.54]Brick by brick — the builder comes.
[02:30.00](OUTRO)
[02:33.19]Not for glory, not for gold,
[02:38.61]But to finish what was told.
[02:44.76]Brick by brick, the phoenix breathes,
[02:52.73]From the weight — eternity.
[02:56.96](CHORUS)
[02:59.28]Brick by brick, I breathe, I rise,
[03:01.11]Heart of work beneath the skies.
[03:05.34]When the world forgets its name,
[03:08.21]I remember — I remain.
